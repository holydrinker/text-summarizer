# text-summarizer
A Python Framework for Extractive Text Summarization.
This work is the project part of the course "Natural Language Processing" from University of Bari (Master Degree in Computer Science).

The core of the framework is a [centroid-based text summarization algorithm](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W/W17/W17-1003.pdf).
The framework has been deployed by a REST service /getSummary.
The project was supervised from [Gaetano Rossiello](http://www.di.uniba.it/~swap/index.php?n=Membri.Rossiello), [Giovanni Semeraro](http://www.di.uniba.it/~swap/index.php?n=Membri.Semeraro), [Pierpaolo Basile](http://www.di.uniba.it/~swap/index.php?n=Membri.Basile).

I work on this project with my classmate (and dear friend) [Giovanni Mastroscianni](https://www.linkedin.com/in/giovanni-mastroscianni-502004106/).
